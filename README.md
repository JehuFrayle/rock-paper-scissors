# Rock-Paper-Scissors
So, I was doing a basic JavaScript course and one of the examples was to do a rock-paper-scissors game. I get a little obssesed with the idea and even after I finished it I have been working on it and using it for other courses.

It started with the logic using the js console, then I impemented a simple **UI** with vanilla **CSS**, then I refactor the code to make it more **reusable** and **scalable**. Currently I'm using it for practice with **webpack** and **deploying** technologies.
